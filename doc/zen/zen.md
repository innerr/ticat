# Zen: the choices we made

## Cost is all

## Ad-hot assembling: small parts work together
* Control
* Gradually evolve, partly improve

## Why cli

## Sequence vs unix-pipe

## Seperate `logic` and `config`

## Abbrs

## Tree

## Env Tree
## Env Layer

## Hub: user centered
* Loose-auth, yet high ...

## radio community: from outside to the center

## Concurent? no
