# Zen: the choices we made

## Why cli?

Q: A normal component platform will use rpc as component API,
then use config files to assemble pieces, or maybe use web-page-based UI.
why cli based component platform?

## Cost is all

Cost is all in engineering. (it toke me more than 10yrs to realize that,
at my early days I was sticking on 'quality').

Since **ticat** is for engineers,
using cli as platform do not compromise much usabilities,
but can greatly reduce the cost of writing a component.

By lower the bar(cost) of component writing,
small solutions could move (from manually executings and casual scripts) into the platform,
that makes a health and strong ecosystem.
