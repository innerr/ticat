# Zen: the choices we made

## Why ticat, why we need a new platform, is that anything the existing ones can't do?

It's overdetermined to list things "**ticat** can, others can't".

It's all about cost,
**ticat** meet our demand with significantly low cost.
(both for users and component developers)

However, here are some features we rarely saw if not in **ticat**:
* Self-sufficient component model, make pieces can easily work together.
* Low cost ad-hot componet assembling, have maximum flexibility to cover any requement.
* Low cost componet developing support.
* User-centered publish model and health community.
