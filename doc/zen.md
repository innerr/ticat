# Zen: the choices we made

## Cost is all

## Ad-hot assembling: small parts work together
* Control
* Gradually evolve, partly improve

## Why cli

## Sequence vs unix-pipe

## Seperate `logic` and `config`

## Abbrs

## Tree

## Env Tree
## Env Layer

## Hub: user centered
* Loose-auth, yet high ...

## radio community: from outside to the center

## Concurent? no

## Target
* Human friendly
    * Easy to understand: lots of features, but well-organized (commands, env, etc)
    * Zero memorizing presure: good searching and full abbrs support
* Rich features
    * Easy to get lots of modules
        * Components can be easily written in any language
        * ..or from any existing utility by wrapping it up (in no time)
    * Easy and powerful configuring
        * Modules are automatically work together, by running on a shared env
        * Anything can be configured by modifying the env
    * Combine modules to flow
* Easy to share context, or to run others'
    * Use github repo-tree to distribute code
    * Share modules and flows easily by adding a top-repo
